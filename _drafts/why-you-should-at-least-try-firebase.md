A few month from now, I was looking to add some real time feature to a website

I found bunch of stuff, like [pusher](https://pusher.com/), [socket.io](http://socket.io/)and of course **[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)**



# The 2 main reasons why you should try (and use) Firebase :

## It sync an save at the same time

If you have a basic CRUD app (or website), you will have to add some real time feature in the future. So why don't you take a real time ready solution right now?

If you write a real time website (or app), you will have to store the data in the future. So why don't you choose a both real time / storage solution right now?


## Firebase is also an hosting solution :)


# A few things that might be improved :

## Having an hacker plan with a custom domain

When you start a simple MVP,

* You have spent weeks to find the name of your product.
* You're so proud to buy our own domain name.
* You set up your really simple MVP.
* You deploy it with the hacker plan (for free).
* You want to communicate about your MVP, to start getting feedback.
* But if you want people to try your MVP on the domain name you own, you have to spend 50$/month
* At this point, you didn't raised any money, your MVP is really really light, the traffic on your website is really really low (normal : it's the beginning :)
* So you decide to host this MVP on a simple server for almost free (like Digital Ocean, Heroku, GitHub Pages, etc...)
* And you think you will switch later, when the next feature is coming, because you really want to enjoy all Firebase great features.
* But when it's happen, you start to think : can I stand on my 5$ host, or do I have to spend 50$ now?
* Of course one day you will switch to an other solution when you start to get people interested about what you do.
* But at this time, how much will you spent to switch to Firebase?

So please Firebase, think about adding custom domain for Hacker plan or create a **spark plan** : Hacker plan + custom domain for about *5$/month*.


## Having a storage like AWS Glacier

Having synchronized/stored data is awesome.
I think it's definitely why Firebase is one a the most powerful tool I have ever seen.
But when you think about it, there is this kind of data you have to keep, but you'll never need to synchronize it.
For example :

* a 2 years old order
* connection log outdated

In fact, as you website is getting older, you have all this data you want to "Archive". That means :

* I really want to keep it.
* I don't care if I have to wait few minutes (may be more) to access it.
* It will be great to pay less (and/or have more space available) to store it.
